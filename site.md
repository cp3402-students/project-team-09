# For TTCMA website maintainers:

## Managing membership applications:

Membership applications are handled with the Ninja Forms WordPress plugin.

Website visitors that fill out the membership form at `/membership-application/` have their details sent to the
wordpress admin accounts' email address for consideration. They are also saved in the wp-admin UI under Admin ->
Ninja Forms -> Submissions.

## Creating new event posts:

Events are organised as WordPress posts.

Events can be managed in the WordPress posts UI in Admin -> Posts -> All Posts.

New Events can be created in the New Post UI and added to the events category by setting the category of a new post to "
events".

When possible, a "Featured image" and an "Excerpt" should be set in the UI for the purpose of presenting a preview when
events are viewed as a summarised list

## Creating new magazine posts:

Magazines are organised as WordPress posts.
